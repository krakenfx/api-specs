external_id:
  description: "Your (the API user's) unique id to globally identify transfers and requests.\n\nWe will accept anything from 1-16 bytes, the format is base64 without padding ( <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64#Decoding_Base64_without_padding> )\n\nThis is the id you will use to identify all transfers and requests in the API and also in the callback we send you.\n\nYou MUST make sure this is commited in your database before calling our API, that way if you don't get a response, you can make the same call again and we'll fail with an error saying your id is already used. (this is the only way to prevent double requests or sends)\n\nWe *highly* recommend you generate and send a UUID here, but if instead you have a database auto-increment id that is 64 bits, just send that, perhaps pre-pended by an application id or something.  The format is completely up to you but keep in mind it must be forever unique across all your transfers and requests."

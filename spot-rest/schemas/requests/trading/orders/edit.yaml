    type: string

      For `iceberg` orders only, it defines the quantity to show in the book while the rest of order quantity remains hidden. Minimum value is 1 / 15 of `volume`.

  pair:
    description: Asset pair `id` or `altname`
    type: string
    # example: XBTUSD
  asset_class:
    description: This parameter is required on requests for non-crypto pairs, i.e. use `tokenized_asset` for xstocks.
    type: string
    enum:
      - tokenized_asset
  price:
    description: |
      Price:
      * Limit price for `limit` and `iceberg` orders
      * Trigger price for `stop-loss`, `stop-loss-limit`, `take-profit`, `take-profit-limit`, `trailing-stop` and `trailing-stop-limit` orders

      Notes:
      * Relative Prices: Either `price` or `price2` can be preceded by `+`, `-`, or `#` to specify the order price as an offset relative to the last traded price. `+` adds the amount to, and `-` subtracts the amount from the last traded price. `#` will either add or subtract the amount to the last traded price, depending on the direction and order type used. Prices can also be suffixed with a `%` to signify the relative amount as a percentage, rather than an absolute price difference.
      * Trailing Stops: Must use a relative price for this field, namely the `+` prefix, from which the direction will be automatic based on if the original order is a buy or sell (no need to use `-` or `#`). The `%` suffix also works for these order types to use a relative percentage price.

    type: string
  price2:
    description: |
      Secondary Price:
      * Limit price for `stop-loss-limit`, `take-profit-limit` and `trailing-stop-limit` orders
      Note:
      * Trailing Stops: Must use a relative price for this field, namely one of the `+` or `-` prefixes. This will provide the offset from the trigger price to the limit price, i.e. +0 would set the limit price equal to the trigger price. The `%` suffix also works for this field to use a relative percentage limit price.

    type: string
  oflags:
    description: |
      Comma delimited list of order flags. Only these flags can be changed: - post post-only order (available when ordertype = limit). All the flags from the parent order are retained except post-only. post-only needs to be explicitly mentioned on edit request.

    type: string
    description: |
      RFC3339 timestamp (e.g. 2021-04-01T00:18:45Z) after which the matching engine should reject the new order request, in presence of latency or order queueing. min now() + 2 seconds, max now() + 60 seconds.  
#Defaults to 90 seconds if not specified.
